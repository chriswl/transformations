This is my mirror of Christoph Gohlke's transformations package, 
maintained at this location: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/

All I did was add his suggested setup.py and put the files into a
format where someone can clone the repository, do

````
python setup.py install
````

and be on their way. The files were retrieved on 26th November 2013. I will
try and keep up to date with upstream, but no guarantees.
